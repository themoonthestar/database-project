This is for MMAI 5100 Database Project Group 6 Submission.

For each conceptual, logical and physical design, a png file is included for reference if inserted images in the report (Database Project Group 6 Report.pdf) are not clear enough.
Dotted lines in logical and physical designs have the same meaning as solid lines but are used to differentiate them from the other part of the composite foreign keys.
An implementation of our database (including samples data) is ready under username: ethanyw (Yi Wang) in our postgres server.
The sql files for creating and populating tables are inclued as "create_table.sql" and "populate_table.sql".
The requested report is named as "Database Project Group 6 Report.pdf".
All assumptions made are listed under each related sections in the report.
For sql files generating Realtek's departmental reports, they are all in the "report_queries" folder. Please run "report_views_run_this_first.sql" first. The other sql files can be executed in discretionary orders.
Report options like showing top/bottom 3 office in sales or changing the time frame of the search are explained in the report and also commented in the sql files.

You can email ethanyw@yorku.ca for any questions.
